Most likely don't use pixels. Other units are more adaptable to screen.
Becareful though, there are exceptions for every case.

FONT-SIZE: use rem.
It's simple and **consistent. Entire document font-size could be adjusted using rem.
em makes complicated. % is also complicated.

WIDTH: use %.
It's used most of the time. Simple and elegant.

HEIGHT: Why would you set height? when screen get's small height get's bigger.
set min-height. Same as width use % or rem.

MARGIN AND PADDING: Use em if you want to scale. Else use rem.

Easier math:
html{
 font-size: 62.5%;
}

.class1{
 font-size: 2.1rem; //Then it is 21pixels
}
